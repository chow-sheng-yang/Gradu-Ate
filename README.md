### 2. Why the project is useful?
Navigating multiple school websites and portals to track your academic progress can often be confusing, and creating your own Excel template can be time-consuming.  

With Gradu-Ate, you can easily download a ready-made Excel template, fill in your course details as you go, and upload the file into the dashboard to instantly visualize your progress.  

This repository also offers a variety of data sources that you‚Äôre welcome to download and use for your own needs.

### 3. How can you get started with this project?
- Firstly, launch the app and you will be directed to a Download Page. If you don't already have a sample formatted excel file, download one! It is important that you use the app's excel template and replace with your own data, to ensure the app works properly.<br><br>
![Download Page](instructions/download.png)<br><br>

- In the sample excel file, there are 2 tabs. Please read the `instructions` tab first before modifying the data sheet.<br><br>

- Once done, click on the `data` tab and start replacing it with your own data! Or, simply use this sample data as a default.<br><br>
